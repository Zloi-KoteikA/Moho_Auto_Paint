 
Moho_Auto-paint - is an application for quick color replacement in your projects.

The replacement takes place by replacing the encoded RGB color in the saved file. Multiple recursive substitution in multiple files at the same time is also supported.

For security reasons, a copy of the file is created before starting work (but it would not be superfluous to make another copy manually). 
  
  How it works:
   - Specify the path to one or more files.
   - In turn, enter one or more HEX color encodings that you want to replace.
   - It is important to enter the colors in the order in which you want to change them.
      
Example: 

  I want to replace "color_№1" with "color_№3" and "color_№2" with "color_№4". 
To do this, I enter the encoding "color_№1" "color_№2" into the string and press enter to continue. Now I enter "color_№3", "color_№4".
